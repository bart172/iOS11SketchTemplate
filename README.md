# iOS11SketchTemplate
A comprehensive set of iOS 11 icons.

Special thanks to Julian Gomez (@Axinen) for creating the PSD file!

I am not the owner of these icons (duh), yet I made them all from scratch, starting from screenshots of various homescreens.

All icons are in @2x format (120x120px), I know some of you may want to work with them in @1x, but I've had some problems fixing the Home icon after a resize. All the other icons look just fine when resized to @1x.

If you want to host this template to your website feel free to do it by linking to this Github page, as I'm planning to constantly update the template.
I ask you not to sell to other people or websites this template, and to mention me in your final work if possible.
