# iOS11SketchTemplate
A comprehensive set of iOS 11 icons.

I am not (duh) the owner of these icons, yet I made them all from scratch, starting from screenshots of various homescreens.

All icons are in @2x format (120x120), I know some of you may want to work with them in @1x, but I've had some problems fixing the Home icon after a resize. All the other icons look just fine when resized to @1x.

I ask you not to sell to other people or websites this template, and to mention me in your final work if possible.
